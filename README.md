Welcome to the Vitis Examples repository! This repository provides a collection of examples designed to showcase the capabilities of the Vitis™ tools, targeting AI Engine and XRT applications.

These examples demonstrate specific scenarios involving host code and kernel programming through concise, functional implementations. They are intended to serve as a reference, helping users develop their own accelerated applications on AMD Accelerated Platforms.

Note: Users can also utilize custom platforms that support the devices in both GUI-based and Makefile-based applications.

# Brief description of the examples
We have 3 category of examples.
- aie_examples : Templates which cover the basic AIE and AIEML capabilities.
- aie_system_examples : This category contains 2 examples. 
    - `aie_sys_design` The example demonstrates a complete system, covering PS, PL, and AI Engine utilization for Versal boards equipped with an AI Engine.
    - `aie-ml_sys_design` The example demonstrates a complete system, covering PS, PL, and AI Engine utilization for Versal boards equipped with an AI Engine ML.
- system_examples : A generic system example, including PS and PL, demonstrates Vector Addition using OpenCL, similar to the "Hello World" example in the C programming language.
